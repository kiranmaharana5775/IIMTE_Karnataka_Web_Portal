                        <br>
                        <p>Understanding the characteristics of successful distance learners is necessary to help identify strategies that are highly effective for a successful distance learning experience. It will be important to determine if learning occurs differently via distance. It is necessary to identify processes teachers use to customize the learning experience and assess “innovative” instructional processes to identify which best help students learn. It’s important to diagnose problems that learners encounter in terms of time and place, along with how the required use of technology affects their motivation. It is also important to determine student expectations for credit courses and why they do not take advantage of distance learning opportunities. It is more important to determine expectations for professional improvement than it is to determine expectations for personal enrichment. It will be important to determine participation and completion rates and assess outcomes of vocational education through Distance Mode.</p>
